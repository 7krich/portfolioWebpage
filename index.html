                Hello! My name is Kyle Richnafsky and I'm a software engineering student at Michigan State University. I'm 28 years old with a financial services background. My main goal is to use my industry knowledge and newfound skills to improve the fintech industry one application at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love spending time with family, hiking, golf and travelling in my free time. Over the years I've sudied economics, sustainability and graphic design. I graduated from the University of Maryland with a B.S. in Economics and a minor in Sustainability in 2018. Prior to that I recieved my A.A. in Visual Arts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I work at Rocket Mortgage as a Credit Underwriter, where I've been for over 2 years. In all, I've accumulated just under 5 years of mortgage industry knowledge while serving various roles. During this time I've realized technology's potential to transform the industry and now I'm focussed on contributing.
            </p>
